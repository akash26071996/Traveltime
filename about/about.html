                <p>Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations.Travel can be done by
                    foot,bicycle automobile,train,boat,bus,airplane,ship or other means, with or without luggage,and
                    can be one way or round trip.The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history.The
                    term "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail,which means 'work'.According to the
                    Merriam Webster dictionary,the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century.It
                    also states that the word comes from Middle English travailen,travelen (which means to torment,
                    labor,strive,journey)and earlier from Old French travailler(which means to work
                    strenuously,toil).In English we still occasionally use the words "travail", which means
                    struggle.According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales,the words "travel"
                    and "travail" both share an even more ancient root:a Roman instrument of torture called the
                    tripalium(in Latin it means "three stakes", as in to impale).This link may reflect the extreme
                    difficulty of travel in ancient times.Travel in modern times may or may not be much easier
                    depending upon the destination.Travel to Mount Everest,the Amazon rainforest,extreme tourism,and
                    adventure travel are more difficult forms of travel.Travel can also be more difficult depending
                    on the method of travel,such as by bus,cruise ship,or even by bullock cart.Reasons for traveling
                    include recreation,tourism or vacationing,research travel along with your friends and faimly to
                    explore the wolrd together.Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than
                    land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of railways in the 19th century. Travel for
                    the purpose of tourism is reported to have started around this time when people began to travel
                    for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging task.
                    A trip may also be part of a round-trip, which is a particular type of travel whereby a person
                    moves from one location to another and returns.Travel may be local, regional, national (domestic) or
                    international. In some countries, non-local internal travel may require an internal passport, while
                    international travel typically requires a passport and visa. Tours are a common type of travel.
                    Examples of travel tours are expedition cruises, small group tours, and river cruises.</p>
