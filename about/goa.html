        <h1 class="">About</h1>
    <p class="text-center">Goa is a state on the southwestern coast of India within the region known as
        the Konkan, and geographically separated from the Deccan highlands by the Western Ghats.It is surrounded
        by the Indian states of Maharashtra to the north and Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian Sea
        forming its western coast. It is India's smallest state by area and its fourth-smallest by population. Goa has
        the highest GDP per capita among all Indian states, two and a half times as high as the GDP per capita of
        the country as a whole.The Eleventh Finance Commission of India named Goa the best-placed state because of
        its infrastructure, and India’s National Commission on Population rated it as having the best quality of life in
        India (based on the commission’s “12 Indicators”). It is the third-highest ranking among Indian states in
        human development index.
        Panaji is the state's capital, while Vasco da Gama is its largest city. The historic city of Margão in Goa still
        exhibits the cultural influence of the Portuguese, who first voyaged to the subcontinent in the early 16th
        century as merchants, and conquered it soon thereafter, whereupon Goa became an overseas territory of the
        Portuguese Empire, part of what was then known as Portuguese India, and remained as such for about 450 years,
        until it was annexed by India in 1961.Goa’s official language, which is spoken by a majority of its
        inhabitants, is Konkani.

        Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year because of its white-sand
        beaches, active nightlife, places of worship, and World Heritage-listed architecture. It also has rich flora and
        fauna because it lies on the Western Ghats range, a biodiversity hotspot.</p>
