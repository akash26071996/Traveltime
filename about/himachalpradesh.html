    <h1 class="">About</h1>
    <p>Manali is a resort and tourist town nestled in the mountains of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh near the
      northern end of the Kullu Valley in the Beas River Valley. It is located in the Kullu district, about 270 km (168
      mi) north of the state capital, Shimla, 309 km (192 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, and 544 km (338 miles)
      northeast of Delhi, the national capital. The small town, with a population of 8,096, is the beginning of an
      ancient trade route to Ladakh and from there over the Karakoram Pass on to Yarkand and Khotan in the Tarim Basin.
      It is a popular tourist destination and serves as the gateway to Lahaul and Spiti district as well as Leh.

    <H2>History</H2>
    <p>Manali is named after the Sanatan Hindu lawgiver Manu. The name Manali is regarded as the derivative of
      'Manu-Alaya' which means 'the abode of Manu'. Legend has it that sage Manu stepped off his ark in Manali to
      recreate human life after a great flood had deluged the world. Manali lies in the North of Kullu Valley. The
      valley is often referred to as the 'Valley of the Gods'. Old Manali village has an ancient temple dedicated to
      sage Manu.

      The British introduced apple trees in the area. The first apple orchard was set up by the British near Patlikuhal,
      before this, no Apple trees grew in the area. To this day, apples— along with plum and pear— remain the best
      source of income for the majority of inhabitants. Both Rainbow and Brown Trout were also introduced into the
      rivers and streams of the area by the colonizers.

      With the increase in disposable incomes and somewhat owing to the rise of disturbances in Kashmir in the late
      1980s, Manali witnessed a surge in tourist traffic. This once quiet village was transformed into a bustling town
      with numerous homestays as well as the occasional boutique hotel. During the warmer summer months, cafes and
      restaurants can be seen doing brisk business</p>

    <H2>Transport</H2>
    <h5>Air</h5>
    <p>The nearest airport Bhuntar Airport (IATA code KUU) is at Bhuntar town, situated on NH21 about 50 km (31 mi)
      south of Manali and 10 km (6.2 mi) south of Kullu town. The airport is also known as Kullu-Manali airport and has
      more than a kilometre long runway. Air India has regular flights to the airport from New Delhi.</p>
    <h5>Helicopter taxi service</h5>
    <p>Pawan Hans, the Government charter agency, provides heli-taxi service connecting Shimla to Chandigarh, Kullu, and
      Dharamshala.</p>
    <h5>Road</h5>
    <p>Manali can be reached from Delhi by national highway NH 1 up to Ambala and from there NH 22 to Chandigarh and
      from there by national highway NH21 that passes through Bilaspur, Sundernagar, Mandi and Kullu towns. The road
      distance from Chandigarh to Manali is 310 km (190 mi), and the total distance from Delhi to Manali is 570 km (350
      mi). Bus services are available from HRTC (Himachal Road Transport Corporation), HPTDC (Himachal Tourism
      Development Corporation), and private operators.</p>
    <h5>Rail</h5>
    <p>There is no close railhead available close to Manali. The nearest broad gauge railheads are at Una 250 km (155
      mi) away, Kiratpur Sahib 268 km (167 mi), Kalka (275 km (171 mi)), Chandigarh (310 km (193 mi)), and Pathankot
      (325 km (202 mi)). The nearest narrow gauge railhead is at Joginder Nagar (175 kilometres (109 mi)). The
      Kalka–Shimla Railway is a nostalgic narrow-gauge route culminating at the state capital of Shimla wherefrom one
      has to travel by road to Manali.</p>
    <h5>Environmental concerns</h5>
    <p>Manali has witnessed a flurry of activity related to hydroelectric power and tourism. Unplanned and rampant
      construction has led to severe depletion of forests and pollution of river bodies, along with garbage being
      disposed of on the side of the mountains. There has been a loss of habitat to various species of fauna, not
      limited to the Himalayan monal, incidentally the state bird of Uttarakhand.</p>
